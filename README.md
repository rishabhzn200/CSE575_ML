# CSE575_ML
This code has used the SkillCraft data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The data has 3,395 instances and 20 attributes. Some basic feature analysis is done to:<br/>
• Plot the frequency histogram on ’GapBetweenPACs’ and ’ActionsInPAC’ attributes,
respectively. [Histogram1.py]

• Plot the scatter figure for the following pairs of features: (1) SelectByHotkeys vs.
AssignToHotkeys, and (2) NumberOfPACs vs. GapBetweenPACs, respectively.[ScatterFig1.py]

• Compute of PCC for all the attributes to determine the positive and negative correlation  among the attributes. Result is stored in “matrix.csv” file.[PCC.py]
